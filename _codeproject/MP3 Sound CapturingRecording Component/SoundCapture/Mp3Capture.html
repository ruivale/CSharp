<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>It&#39;s surprising that there are no components for sound capture in .NET Framework 
    3.5. Even designers of WPF and Silverlight 2.0 were focused on graphics so 
    deeply that they forgot about applications which have to record sound from 
    user&#39;s microphone. It is said that the next version of Silverlight will provide 
    such functionality.</p>
    <p>However, what you often want to achieve is to store the recorded sound in MP3 
        file (or sent it as MP3 stream). That&#39;s legally complicated due to MP3 patent 
        constraints. And for the same legal reason we can assume that we will not see 
        MP3 functionality in Microsoft technologies soon (there is WMA instead).</p>
    <p>Here you find an easy to use .NET 3.5 component providing Sound Capture 
        functionality for a Windows application. It outputs data as raw PCM samples or a 
        regular WAV file. Or you can just set one boolean property to use LAME dll to 
        MP3-compress during the streaming process.</p>
    <p>This article uses a subset of <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/MP3Compressor.aspx">C# MP3 Compressor</a> libraries written by
        <a href="../../../script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=325803">Idael Cardoso</a> which in turn are partially based on <A href="http://www.codeproject.com/cs/media/cswavplay.asp">A low level audio player in C#</A> by <A href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/profile/whos_who.asp?id=90428">Ianier Munoz</A>. See <A href="http://www.mp3dev.org/" target=_blank>this website</A> for technical and copyright information regarding the LAME project. </p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I chose DirectX Managed (MDX) 1.1 as means of capturing sound. The MDX project is 
    currently frozen since Microsoft moved to XNA Game Studio Express (a solution 
    rather inadequate just for capturing bits of sound). MDX is descended by SlimDX Open 
    Source project which roughly bases on similar interfaces to native DirectSound 
    libraries. MDX is sufficient for our purpose. It is a set of .NET assemblies 
    delegating calls to native DirectX dlls of 2006. We expect DirectX in a version 
    backward compatible with the 2006 interfaces to be installed virtually on every 
    Windows computer (yes, works also on Vista). </p>
<p>The component captures sound via MDX (DirectX) from a sound card in raw PCM 
    format. PCM format is a simple sequence of sound sample values. The samples can be 
    8bit (0..255) or 16bit (-32768..32767) each. Stereo sound is a sequence of pairs 
    of samples (left, right, left, right...). PCM is a proper format for streaming 
    of raw data. Streaming means passing data in small chunks while the total volume 
    of the data may be unknown. Raw PCM is the basic type of output of the 
    <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code> component. If you direct stream of this format to a wav file, 
    you <b>will not be able to play it</b> as WAV file must additionallycontain a 
    RIFF header. </p>
<p>WAV (RIFF) format requires the raw PCM data to be prefixed with RIFF header which 
    apart from format information contains also information about the total length 
    of the PCM data in the file. That&#39;s why you can&#39;t really stream RIFF data as the 
    total size of the stream is usually unknown. WAV (RIFF) format is the second 
    type of output of the <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code> component. If you direct stream of this 
    format to a wav file, <b>you can play it</b>.</p>
<p>The third type of <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code> component output is MP3. Bit rate (kbit/s) is a 
        parameter which decides of MP3 sound quality. Apart from that, the sound quality 
        depends on the format of PCM data being compressed. Currently <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code> 
        component is only able to compress 22kHz, 16bit PCM data (that&#39;s what I needed, 
        you may tweak the code referring to <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/">LAME documentation</a> in order to extend it). 
    If you direct stream of this format to an MP3 file, <b>you can play it</b>.</p>
    
<h2>Using the code</h2>
<h3>Setting up</h3>
<p>From your application add a reference to <code>Istrib.Sound.Mp3.dll</code> assembly (see 
    <code>Istrib.Sound.Example.WinForms</code> for example). MP3 compression requires also 
    <code>lame_enc.dll</code> library to be located in binaries directory. If you 
    experience &quot;Loader Lock&quot; warning while debugging your application refer <a href="#LoaderLock">here</a> for 
    a workaround.</p>

<p> <code>Istrib.Sound.Mp3.dll</code> assembly contains a single component: <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code>. You may think of this 
    component as of a sound recorder. You set up its properties prior to calling <code>Start(...)</code> and <code>Stop()</code> 
    methods 
    (&quot;recorder buttons&quot;). You provide a writeable stream or a file 
    path to each call to the <code>Start</code> method. Single instance of the 
    component may capture sound many times to many streams/files one by one.</p>
<h4>Component construction</h4>
You may use VS Component Designer to drag and drop the <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code> component form VS toolbox to the component surface
or create the component manually:
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture = new Mp3SoundCapture();
</pre>
    <p>The 
    component is ready to use just after construction. The default output is MP3 128kbit/s sampled at 22kHz, 16bit, mono. You specify sampling 
    parameters and output format by setting the component&#39;s properties.</p>
<h4>Specifying the capturing device (e.g. a microphone)</h4>
<p>You may use a default Windows recording device:</p>
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture.CaptureDevice = SoundCaptureDevice.Default;
</pre>
<p>Or choose one of the installed system sound capture devices:</p>
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture.CaptureDevice = SoundCaptureDevice.AllAvailable.First();
</pre>

<h4>Specifying the output format</h4>
<p>You set one of the 3 output types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Mp3SoundCapture.Outputs.Mp3</code> - MP3 format</li>
    <li><code>Mp3SoundCapture.Outputs.RawPcm</code> - Raw sample data (without a RIFF header)</li>
    <li><code>Mp3SoundCapture.Outputs.Wav</code> - WAV file data (including the RIFF header)</li>    
</ul>
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture.OutputType = Mp3SoundCapture.Outputs.Mp3;
</pre>

<h4>Specifying the sampling parameters</h4>
<p>For PCM or WAV output you may select any available sampling parameters supported by the sound card (<code>PcmSoundFormat.StandardFormats</code>):</p>
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture.WaveFormat = PcmSoundFormat.StandardFormats.First();
</pre>
or
    when you wish to hardcode it:
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture.WaveFormat = PcmSoundFormat.Pcm22kHz16bitMono;
</pre>
<p>Sampling parameters for MP3 format are currently restricted to two values: <code>PcmSoundFormat.Pcm22kHz16bitMono</code> or <code>PcmSoundFormat.Pcm22kHz16bitStereo</code>:</p>
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture.WaveFormat = Mp3SoundFormat.ValidSourceFormats.First();
</pre>

<h4>Specifying the MP3 bit rate</h4>
<p>For MP3 output format you specify one of the available bit rates:</p>
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture.Mp3BitRate = Mp3BitRate.ValidValues.First();
</pre>
or when you wish to hardcode it:
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture.Mp3BitRate = Mp3BitRate.BitRate128;
</pre>

<h4>Specifying Volume Normalization Option</h4>
<p>Often when an application records and stores many pieces of sound it is required to adjust volume o them so that all of them were at similar
volume level. The <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code> has <code>NormalizeVolume</code> property at your disposal to perform the transform for you. Setting true
causes all recorded sound pieces to be normalized i.e. volume of the most loud section of the piece will be turned up to the highest possible level and all
other sections will be turned up proportionally.</p>
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture.NormalizeVolume = true;
</pre>
<p>Note that normalization algorithm must read the whole stream to find the loudest place, then rewrite the whole stream adjusting the volume of each sample.
It means that the entire stream must be buffered before it is directed to the output. <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code> uses a temporary file to buffer the data
when normalizing. MP3 compression, if applied, is done after the normalization. When you have recorded a sizeable piece
of sound the gross of processing takes place <b>after calling Stop()</b> method, not in the fly (as is when NormalizeVolume is false). It may take
time. Here <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code> offers an <a href="#AsyncStop">asynchronous stopping</a>.</p>

<h3>Capturing</h3>

<p>To start capturing just call <code>Start(Stream)</code> method passing an open, writeable stream (you must close it yourself after capturing has stopped
- not obvious when using <a href="#AsyncStop">asynchronous stopping</a>).
You may also call <code>Start(string)</code> method passing an output file name.</p>
<p>To stop capturing just call <code>Stop()</code> method.</p>

<h3><a name="AsyncStop">Asynchronous Stop()</a></h3>

<p>As mentioned <a href="#Normalization">above</a>, when normalizing, it may take some time after calling <code>Stop()</code> before all output data is ready. 
    <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code> has an option of immediately leaving <code>Capturing</code> state and passing all buffer processing to a separate thread. You can then
    start next recording not waiting for all data from the previous recording 
    session to be written to the output buffer / file. By default the asynchronous 
    behavior is disabled. To enable it, set:</p>
<pre>
    mp3SoundCapture.WaitOnStop = false;
</pre>
<p>Note that you cannot close your output buffer passed to <code>Start(Stream)</code> method until a <code>Mp3SoundCapture.Stopped</code> event is fired. 
Use <code>Stopped</code> event arguments to get the reference to the stream which is ready for closing or - if you used <code>Start(string filePath)</code> 
- a path of the file which has just been closed by <code>Mp3SoundCapture</code>.</p>

<h2>Points of Interest</h2>

<p>In some development environment configurations you may get <a name="LoaderLock"><b>&quot;Loader Lock&quot; error</b></a>
    (which is really a warning) while starting your 
    application under the debugger. It&#39;s a 
    known design issue in Managed DirectX. You may disable this error in Visual 
    Studio debugger settings (most of people do this without observable 
    consequences). I preferred not to do this. Instead I found a workaround: if the 
    project which references <code>Istrib.Sound.Mp3.dll</code> also explicitly 
    references Managed DirectX assemblies (<code>Microsoft.DirectX</code> and 
    <code>Microsoft.DirectX.DirectSound</code>), then the warning is not raised. 
    Otherwise the warning is shown by the debugger each time any assembly 
    referencing Managed DirectX libraries is loaded into the Application Domain. </p>
<p>However - what I experienced - <b>you cannot use <i>Visual Studio Add Reference...</i> wizard</b> 
    to add the DirectX assembly reference. If you did that the DirectX layer would 
    not work at all. What you have to do is to open your csproj file with a text 
    editor and add references manually:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
        ...
        &lt;Reference Include="Microsoft.DirectX"&gt;
          &lt;Name&gt;Microsoft.DirectX&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;/Reference&gt;
        &lt;Reference Include="Microsoft.DirectX.DirectSound"&gt;
          &lt;Name&gt;Microsoft.DirectX.DirectSound&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;/Reference&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</pre>

<i>Visual Studio Add Reference...</i> wizard generates identical XML except it includes full assembly version info. Should work as well... But it does
not at least on my machines.
