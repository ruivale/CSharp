Requirements
 - .NET Framework 1.1 or above. (I think! ;-) )


Before NT Service install:
 - edit "WinDBS.exe.config" and change the "XPTO" string with your login. The HOMEDIR var should be pointing to your homedir. NOTE: the dir path must end with '\' (reverse slash).


INSTALLING
 - just execute the _InstallWinService.bat script. (Assuming the .NET Framework is installed at "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\").


UNISTALLING
 - just execute the _UninstallWinService.bat script. (Assuming the .NET Framework is installed at "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\").
